# redditmemebot
Template for my bot, takes content from Reddit and posts to Twitter or Facebook.  Written in Python, requires Tweepy, Praw, Facebook, and a few other modules, so credit to the people who made those.

No longer works due to API changes on all 3 platforms :(
Bring back free API usage!
